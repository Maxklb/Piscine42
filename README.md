<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">42 Piscine - My Journey</h1>

Welcome to my Github repository documenting everything I did during my "Piscine" at 42 Paris ! This repository contains all my "Days" and "Rushes" from this coding bootcamp.

Each folder represents a "Day" or a "Rush". Inside each folder, you'll find subfolders for each exercise (exXX).

## Highlights

Shell projects : Basic commands, file management, and automation.
C projects : From the basics of variables and loops to more complex concepts like memory management.
Rushes projects : Collaborated with random peers on projects and code reviews

## How to use this repository

Feel free to browse through the folders and files to see my solutions and projects.
Each exercise is contained within its respective folder, with accompanying README files to explain what I did.


## THANK YOU FOR VISITING MY REPOSITORY !!
